# Module Retrospective

## Personal

<!-- How did you do in this module? -->

It was hard because there was a lot of new things to learn and practice right away

### What was not clear, where did you get stuck? I had to do a lot of self study to understand Terminal (I still find it a bit intimidating)

### What was clear, what did you master? After doing a lot of extra studying I find I understand Terminal more, but still lots to learn

### Where can you still use some help?

### Where can you help others moving forwards? I was able to help a co student when she reached out, I was happy to do that

## Coaches

<!-- How did the coaches do in this module? -->

### Were they respectful and supportive? Yes, and very encouraging 

### Did they manage class well? Yes
